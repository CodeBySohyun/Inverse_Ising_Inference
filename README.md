# Inverse Ising Inference on Foreign Exchange Markets

## Overview
This repository contains the work for a final year Physics project at the University of Bristol, applying inverse Ising inference to analyse correlations between currency pairs in foreign exchange markets.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**:
  - `ising_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Data preprocessing.
  - `ising_optimisation_original.ipynb`: Preliminary work for model optimisation with detailed comments
  - `ising_optimisation.ipynb`: Streamlined code for model optimisation.
  - `ising_statistics.ipynb`: Statistical analysis.
  - `ising_visualisation.ipynb`: Data and model visualisation.

- **Scripts**:
  - `network_app.py`: Interactive network analysis application.
  - `network_pdf.py`: PDF report generation for network analysis.
  - `decorators.py`: Augments analysis script functionality.

- **Additional Resources**:
  - `Data/`: Historical exchange rate data.
  - `Interim_Report.pdf`: Project objectives and findings summary.
  - `References/`: Theoretical and methodological literature.

## Execution Guide
Process and analyse data in the following sequence:
1. `ising_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Prepares data for modelling.
2. `ising_optimisation.ipynb`: Fits the Ising model to the data.
3. `ising_visualisation.ipynb` & `ising_statistics.ipynb`: Visualisation and statistical analysis.
4. `network_app.py` & `network_pdf.py`: Network analysis.

For detailed execution instructions, please refer to the individual files.
