# Inverse Ising Inference on Foreign Exchange Markets

## Overview
This repository hosts my Physics final year project from the University of Bristol, focusing on applying inverse Ising inference to analyse correlations in foreign exchange markets. The core idea revolves around understanding the true underlying relationships between different currency pairs, considering both direct and indirect interactions influenced by global economic factors.

## Project Description
My project aims to transcend traditional statistical methods of measuring correlation coefficients by employing a physics-inspired techniqueâ€”inverse Ising inference. I draw parallels from condensed matter physics, viewing currencies as a network of spins, each influencing its neighbour. This model helps me understand not just direct correlations but also indirect influences, thus revealing the true structure of currency relationships.

I apply machine learning techniques to fit a spin model to financial data, examining currencies' intricate dynamics. My focus lies in differentiating genuine connections from apparent correlations caused by intermediary influences. This approach, novel in the realm of financial analysis, seeks to uncover the underlying structure of currency correlations, potentially reshaped by major global events or economic shifts.

## Methodology
My methodology maps currencies onto a network of spins, with each currency pair connection represented by coupling constants. I investigate these relationships over time, hypothesising that they undergo phase transitions, influenced by economic events like the 2008 financial crash or the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study utilises a pseudo-likelihood maximisation approach, a variant of Maximum Likelihood Estimation, suitable for large datasets and intricate networks like foreign exchange markets. My analysis spans from the early 2000s, post the introduction of the Euro, to present times, focusing on freely floating currencies and excluding those under heavy governmental control.
